As the driver was approaching the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue, a motorist, who was driving straight through a red light, suddenly appeared before him. Trying to avoid the motorist, the driver veered his car onto the sidewalk. The car landed in a deep hole in the sidewalk. This hole had been dug by a construction company, which had been repairing a water main break earlier in the day. The construction company had been hired by the local municipal water department. Although the' construction company had erected a warning sign advising pedestrians about the hole, there was no fence or barrier surrounding it.

The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.\nB. The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.\nC. The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.\nD. Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force. However, the engagement of armed forces to strengthen institutions may stop this process. Inability to foster 'stateness' is reversed by the use of violence. Social disquiet is a semi-permanent situation of emergent but not developed anarchy.\n\nAnswer:",

The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:\"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. \" The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?\n\nOptions:\nA. The option was unenforceable because it was not included in the written lease.\nB. The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.\nC. The option to purchase was not exercised within the term of the lease.\nD. The tenant failed to pay the full amount of rent as required by the lease.\nE. The farmer's promise to survey the tract was an unfulfilled condition precedent to the tenant's right to purchase.\nF. The farmer never consented to the tenant's exercise of the option.\nG. The tenant's construction of an irrigation ditch constituted a material breach of the lease.\nH. The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\nI. The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.\nJ. The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.\n\nAnswer:",

There were no warning signs keeping pedestrians out or warning of unloading trucks. A pedestrian walked through the general vicinity but he avoided the unloading area. One of the workers pulled the wrong lever and a load of commercial refrigerators crashed into the street, causing a rumbling tremor in the road. The tremor caused a heavy box to fall off of a parked truck that was about 30 yards away from the loading dock. It fell on the pedestrian, causing serious injury. The pedestrian sued the appliance store for negligence, and the store defended on the basis that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts. Will the pedestrian likely survive the store's motion to dismiss pedestrian's lawsuit for damages.\n\nOptions:\nA. No, the accident was caused by a worker's mistake, not a lack of warning signs or barriers.\nB. No, because the plaintiff in effect became a trespasser when he walked into a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nC. Yes, the appliance store has a duty of care to ensure the safety of pedestrians around their loading/unloading area.\nD. Yes, the appliance store was negligent in not having the proper warning signs or barriers to prevent such accidents.\nE. Yes, the store's negligence in operating their loading dock caused a dangerous situation that led to the pedestrian's injury.\nF. No, because the pedestrian was beyond the immediate danger area and the store could not have predicted the box falling from a separate truck.\nG. No, the plaintiff clearly assumed the risk by entering a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nH. Yes, because the plaintiff pedestrian had a right to be where he was and there were no signs telling him otherwise.\nI. No, the accident was a result of a series of unforeseeable events and not directly due to the store's actions.\nJ. Yes, because the chain of causation was generally foreseeable in that it was a logical consequence of a truckload of appliances falling violently onto the road.\n\nAnswer:",

As the driver was approaching the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue, a motorist, who was driving straight through a red light, suddenly appeared before him. Trying to avoid the motorist, the driver veered his car onto the sidewalk. The car landed in a deep hole in the sidewalk. This hole had been dug by a construction company, which had been repairing a water main break earlier in the day. The construction company had been hired by the local municipal water department. Although the' construction company had erected a warning sign advising pedestrians about the hole, there was no fence or barrier surrounding it. When the driver's car fell into the hole, it ruptured the water main, engulfing the car with water. Within a short time, the driver, unable to escape, drowned in his car, which rapidly filled with water. In a wrongful death action by the driver's estate against the municipal water department, the estate will most probably\n\nOptions:\nA. not prevail, because the municipal water department would not be liable for the negligence of its independent contractor.\nB. not prevail, because the driver was negligent for driving onto the sidewalk.\nC. prevail, as the municipal water department is responsible for the safe operation of its contractors.\nD. prevail, because the city government would be strictly liable for failing to ensure the water main repair work was done properly.\nE. not prevail, as the municipal water department had no control over the actions of the driver or the other motorist.\nF. not prevail, because sovereign immunity attaches to functions that are governmental in nature.\nG. prevail, because the construction company failed to adequately warn the public of the hazard.\nH. not prevail, because the accident was caused by the actions of another motorist, not the municipal water department.\nI. prevail, because sovereign immunity would not attach to non-delegable duties, which are proprietary in nature.\nJ. prevail, because the municipal water department failed to ensure that the construction company had put adequate safety measures in place.\n\nAnswer:",

The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.\nB. The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.\nC. The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.\nD. Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force. However, the engagement of armed forces to strengthen institutions may stop this process. Inability to foster 'stateness' is reversed by the use of violence. Social disquiet is a semi-permanent situation of emergent but not developed anarchy.\n\nAnswer:",

The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:\"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. \" The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?\n\nOptions:\nA. The option was unenforceable because it was not included in the written lease.\nB. The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.\nC. The option to purchase was not exercised within the term of the lease.\nD. The tenant failed to pay the full amount of rent as required by the lease.\nE. The farmer's promise to survey the tract was an unfulfilled condition precedent to the tenant's right to purchase.\nF. The farmer never consented to the tenant's exercise of the option.\nG. The tenant's construction of an irrigation ditch constituted a material breach of the lease.\nH. The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\nI. The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.\nJ. The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.\n\nAnswer:",

For safety concerns, the condominium association amended the covenants and restrictions toprohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment did not affect families withchildren already living in balcony units. The amendment was promptly recorded. The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association. Subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, the owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a familywith minor children. Before the closing, the association told the buyers that because they had minor children,they could not buy the unit. The association further told the buyers that numerous units were available in thebuilding without balconies. After receiving this notification, the buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming that the amendmentwas unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws. Is there reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred?\n\nOptions:\nA. Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.\nB. No, because the amendment was promptly recorded and is legally binding.\nC. Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.\nD.

There were no warning signs keeping pedestrians out or warning of unloading trucks. A pedestrian walked through the general vicinity but he avoided the unloading area. One of the workers pulled the wrong lever and a load of commercial refrigerators crashed into the street, causing a rumbling tremor in the road. The tremor caused a heavy box to fall off of a parked truck that was about 30 yards away from the loading dock. It fell on the pedestrian, causing serious injury. The pedestrian sued the appliance store for negligence, and the store defended on the basis that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts. Will the pedestrian likely survive the store's motion to dismiss pedestrian's lawsuit for damages.\n\nOptions:\nA. No, the accident was caused by a worker's mistake, not a lack of warning signs or barriers.\nB. No, because the plaintiff in effect became a trespasser when he walked into a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nC. Yes, the appliance store has a duty of care to ensure the safety of pedestrians around their loading/unloading area.\nD. Yes, the appliance store was negligent in not having the proper warning signs or barriers to prevent such accidents.\nE.

No, because the pedestrian was beyond the immediate danger area and the store could not have predicted the box falling from a separate truck.\nG. No, the plaintiff clearly assumed the risk by entering a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nH. Yes, because the plaintiff pedestrian had a right to be where he was and there were no signs telling him otherwise.\nI. No, the accident was a result of a series of unforeseeable events and not directly due to the store's actions.\nJ. Yes, because the chain of causation was generally foreseeable in that it was a logical consequence of a truckload of appliances falling violently onto the road.\n\nAnswer:",

As the driver was approaching the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue, a motorist, who was driving straight through a red light, suddenly appeared before him. Trying to avoid the motorist, the driver veered his car onto the sidewalk. The car landed in a deep hole in the sidewalk.

Although the' construction company had erected a warning sign advising pedestrians about the hole, there was no fence or barrier surrounding it. When the driver's car fell into the hole, it ruptured the water main, engulfing the car with water.

However, a study by the federal Food and Drug Administration revealed that the pies contain potentially harmful levels of nuts for some consumers with nut allergies. As a result, Congress enacted legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines. A state has a statute that regulates the shipment and sale of the pies within its territory. In light of the federal legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines, the state statute is probably\n\nOptions:\nA. constitutional, because it is within the state's police power.\nB. unconstitutional, because the federal law takes precedence in matters of public safety.\nC. constitutional, because the state has a compelling interest in protecting its citizens.\nD. unconstitutional, because it infringes on the rights of the pie company.\nE. constitutional, because Congress did not expressly preempt state legislation.\nF. constitutional, because the state has the right to regulate all commerce within its borders.\nG. constitutional, because Congress may not regulate an economic activity where both buyer and seller reside in the same state.\nH. unconstitutional, because it affects interstate commerce.\nI. unconstitutional, because the state cannot contradict federal regulations.\n\nAnswer:",

The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.\nB. The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.\nC. The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.\nD. Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force. However, the engagement of armed forces to strengthen institutions may stop this process. Inability to foster 'stateness' is reversed by the use of violence. Social disquiet is a semi-permanent situation of emergent but not developed anarchy.\n\nAnswer:",

The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:\"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. \" The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?\n\nOptions:\nA. The option was unenforceable because it was not included in the written lease.\nB. The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.\nC. The option to purchase was not exercised within the term of the lease.\nD. The tenant failed to pay the full amount of rent as required by the lease.\nE. The farmer's promise to survey the tract was an unfulfilled condition precedent to the tenant's right to purchase.\nF. The farmer never consented to the tenant's exercise of the option.\nG. The tenant's construction of an irrigation ditch constituted a material breach of the lease.\nH. The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\nI. The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.\nJ. The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.\n\nAnswer:",

The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association.

There were no warning signs keeping pedestrians out or warning of unloading trucks. A pedestrian walked through the general vicinity but he avoided the unloading area. One of the workers pulled the wrong lever and a load of commercial refrigerators crashed into the street, causing a rumbling tremor in the road. The tremor caused a heavy box to fall off of a parked truck that was about 30 yards away from the loading dock. It fell on the pedestrian, causing serious injury. The pedestrian sued the appliance store for negligence, and the store defended on the basis that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts. Will the pedestrian likely survive the store's motion to dismiss pedestrian's lawsuit for damages.\n\nOptions:\nA. No, the accident was caused by a worker's mistake, not a lack of warning signs or barriers.\nB. No, because the plaintiff in effect became a trespasser when he walked into a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nC. Yes, the appliance store has a duty of care to ensure the safety of pedestrians around their loading/unloading area.\nD. Yes, the appliance store was negligent in not having the proper warning signs or barriers to prevent such accidents.\nE. Yes, the store's negligence in operating their loading dock caused a dangerous situation that led to the pedestrian's injury.\nF. No, because the pedestrian was beyond the immediate danger area and the store could not have predicted the box falling from a separate truck.\nG. No, the plaintiff clearly assumed the risk by entering a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nH. Yes, because the plaintiff pedestrian had a right to be where he was and there were no signs telling him otherwise.\nI. No, the accident was a result of a series of unforeseeable events and not directly due to the store's actions.\nJ. Yes, because the chain of causation was generally foreseeable in that it was a logical consequence of a truckload of appliances falling violently onto the road.\n\nAnswer:",

As the driver was approaching the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue, a motorist, who was driving straight through a red light, suddenly appeared before him. Trying to avoid the motorist, the driver veered his car onto the sidewalk. The car landed in a deep hole in the sidewalk. This hole had been dug by a construction company, which had been repairing a water main break earlier in the day. The construction company had been hired by the local municipal water department. Although the' construction company had erected a warning sign advising pedestrians about the hole, there was no fence or barrier surrounding it. When the driver's car fell into the hole, it ruptured the water main, engulfing the car with water.

The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.\nB. The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.\nC. The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.\nD. Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force. However, the engagement of armed forces to strengthen institutions may stop this process. Inability to foster 'stateness' is reversed by the use of violence. Social disquiet is a semi-permanent situation of emergent but not developed anarchy.\n\nAnswer:",

The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:\"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. \" The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?\n\nOptions:\nA. The option was unenforceable because it was not included in the written lease.\nB. The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.\nC. The option to purchase was not exercised within the term of the lease.\nD. The tenant failed to pay the full amount of rent as required by the lease.\nE. The farmer's promise to survey the tract was an unfulfilled condition precedent to the tenant's right to purchase.\nF. The farmer never consented to the tenant's exercise of the option.\nG. The tenant's construction of an irrigation ditch constituted a material breach of the lease.\nH. The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\nI. The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.\nJ. The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.\n\nAnswer:",

For safety concerns, the condominium association amended the covenants and restrictions toprohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment did not affect families withchildren already living in balcony units. The amendment was promptly recorded. The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association. Subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, the owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a familywith minor children. Before the closing, the association told the buyers that because they had minor children,they could not buy the unit. The association further told the buyers that numerous units were available in thebuilding without balconies. After receiving this notification, the buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming that the amendmentwas unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws. Is there reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred?\n\nOptions:\nA. Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.\nB. No, because the amendment was promptly recorded and is legally binding.\nC. Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.\nD.

There were no warning signs keeping pedestrians out or warning of unloading trucks. A pedestrian walked through the general vicinity but he avoided the unloading area. One of the workers pulled the wrong lever and a load of commercial refrigerators crashed into the street, causing a rumbling tremor in the road. The tremor caused a heavy box to fall off of a parked truck that was about 30 yards away from the loading dock. It fell on the pedestrian, causing serious injury. The pedestrian sued the appliance store for negligence, and the store defended on the basis that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts. Will the pedestrian likely survive the store's motion to dismiss pedestrian's lawsuit for damages.\n\nOptions:\nA. No, the accident was caused by a worker's mistake, not a lack of warning signs or barriers.\nB. No, because the plaintiff in effect became a trespasser when he walked into a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nC. Yes, the appliance store has a duty of care to ensure the safety of pedestrians around their loading/unloading area.\nD. Yes, the appliance store was negligent in not having the proper warning signs or barriers to prevent such accidents.\nE.

No, because the pedestrian was beyond the immediate danger area and the store could not have predicted the box falling from a separate truck.\nG. No, the plaintiff clearly assumed the risk by entering a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nH. Yes, because the plaintiff pedestrian had a right to be where he was and there were no signs telling him otherwise.\nI. No, the accident was a result of a series of unforeseeable events and not directly due to the store's actions.\nJ.

As the driver was approaching the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue, a motorist, who was driving straight through a red light, suddenly appeared before him. Trying to avoid the motorist, the driver veered his car onto the sidewalk. The car landed in a deep hole in the sidewalk. This hole had been dug by a construction company, which had been repairing a water main break earlier in the day. The construction company had been hired by the local municipal water department. Although the' construction company had erected a warning sign advising pedestrians about the hole, there was no fence or barrier surrounding it. When the driver's car fell into the hole, it ruptured the water main, engulfing the car with water.

The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.\nB. The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.\nC. The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.\nD. Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force. However, the engagement of armed forces to strengthen institutions may stop this process. Inability to foster 'stateness' is reversed by the use of violence. Social disquiet is a semi-permanent situation of emergent but not developed anarchy.\n\nAnswer:",

The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:\"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. \" The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?\n\nOptions:\nA. The option was unenforceable because it was not included in the written lease.\nB. The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.\nC. The option to purchase was not exercised within the term of the lease.\nD. The tenant failed to pay the full amount of rent as required by the lease.\nE. The farmer's promise to survey the tract was an unfulfilled condition precedent to the tenant's right to purchase.\nF. The farmer never consented to the tenant's exercise of the option.\nG. The tenant's construction of an irrigation ditch constituted a material breach of the lease.\nH. The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\nI. The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.\nJ. The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.\n\nAnswer:",

The tremor caused a heavy box to fall off of a parked truck that was about 30 yards away from the loading dock. It fell on the pedestrian, causing serious injury. The pedestrian sued the appliance store for negligence, and the store defended on the basis that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts. Will the pedestrian likely survive the store's motion to dismiss pedestrian's lawsuit for damages.\n\nOptions:\nA. No, the accident was caused by a worker's mistake, not a lack of warning signs or barriers.\nB. No, because the plaintiff in effect became a trespasser when he walked into a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nC. Yes, the appliance store has a duty of care to ensure the safety of pedestrians around their loading/unloading area.\nD. Yes, the appliance store was negligent in not having the proper warning signs or barriers to prevent such accidents.\nE. Yes, the store's negligence in operating their loading dock caused a dangerous situation that led to the pedestrian's injury.\nF. No, because the pedestrian was beyond the immediate danger area and the store could not have predicted the box falling from a separate truck.\nG. No, the plaintiff clearly assumed the risk by entering a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nH. Yes, because the plaintiff pedestrian had a right to be where he was and there were no signs telling him otherwise.\nI. No, the accident was a result of a series of unforeseeable events and not directly due to the store's actions.\nJ. Yes, because the chain of causation was generally foreseeable in that it was a logical consequence of a truckload of appliances falling violently onto the road.\n\nAnswer:",
