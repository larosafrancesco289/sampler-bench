Emma clutched her phone, the dim glow of the flashlight app barely piercing the thick night. She had been on her way home from work when the streetlights flickered and died, leaving her stranded in the middle of the sidewalk.\n\n\"Great,\" she muttered, glancing around. The usual hum of traffic was gone, replaced by an eerie silence. Then, a voice called out from the shadows.\n\n\"Need some light?\"\n\nEmma turned to see a man holding a lantern, its warm glow casting long shadows. He was tall, with a friendly smile and a backpack slung over one shoulder.\n\n\"Yeah, thanks,\" she said, stepping closer. \"I was just trying to figure out how to get home.\"\n\n\"Same,\" he said, extending the lantern toward her. \"I\u2019m Jake, by the way.\"\n\n\"Emma.\"\n\nThey walked together, the lantern\u2019s light guiding them through the dark streets. The air smelled of rain and distant smoke, and the occasional distant shout echoed in the stillness.\n\n\"So, what do you do, Emma?\" Jake asked.\n\n\"I\u2019m a librarian,\" she said. \"You?\"\n\n\"Musician. I was actually on my way to a gig when this happened.\"\n\nEmma laughed. \"Well, at least you won\u2019t have to worry about an audience now.\"\n\nJake grinned. \"True. But I\u2019d rather have power than a crowd.\"\n\nThey turned a corner, and Emma recognized her street. \"This is me,\" she said, pointing to her apartment building. \"Thanks for the light\u2014and the company.\"\n\n\"Anytime,\" Jake said. \"Hey, if you ever want to hear some music, I play at the Blue Note on Fridays.\"\n\nEmma hesitated, then smiled. \"I might just take you up on that.\"\n\nAs she unlocked her door, she glanced back. Jake was already walking away, the lantern swinging gently at his side. She wondered if she\u2019d ever see him again.\n\nThen, as she stepped inside, her phone buzzed. A text from her sister: *Did you hear? The power\u2019s out all over the city.*\n\nEmma smiled. Maybe fate had a way of bringing people together\u2014even in the dark.\n\n---\n\n**Word Count: 350**",
