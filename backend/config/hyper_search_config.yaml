# Test prompts for creative writing evaluation
test_prompts:
  - "Write a short story about discovering a hidden room in an old library that contains books from parallel universes."
  - "Create a story where the protagonist can hear other people's thoughts, but only the thoughts they don't want to share."
  - "Tell a tale about a world where colors have started disappearing one by one, and your character is the only one who notices."
  - "Write about someone who wakes up with a completely different personality every morning."
  - "Create a story about a small caf√© that exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously."
